# Vehicle Smoke Emission Detection System

This project aims to detect smoke-emitting vehicles using Object Detection (YOLO) to support pollution control and enable greener and sustainable transportation. It identifies vehicles in real-time from video feeds, laying the foundation for detecting harmful smoke emissions in upcoming development phases.

## Week 1 Progress 
- Finalized project idea and problem statement
- Decided the tech stack (Python, YOLOv8, OpenCV)
- Created initial folder structure and GitHub repository
- Basic YOLO setup added for vehicle detection (to be enhanced in Week 2)

## Tech Stack
- Python
- YOLOv8
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## Upcoming (Week 2)
- Add smoke detection logic
- Create alert logging system
